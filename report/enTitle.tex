\en-abstract{
Large-scale pretrained models such as LXMERT are becoming popular for learning cross-modal representations on text-image pairs for vision-language tasks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, NLP and computer vision models contain smaller subnetworks capable of being trained in isolation to full performance. In this project, we combine these observations to evaluate whether such trainable subnetworks exist in LXMERT when fine-tuned on the VQA task. In addition, we perform a model size cost-benefit analysis by investigating how much pruning can be done without significant loss in accuracy.
